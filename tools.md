Here's what I'm currently using in the kitchen. Generally, I'm not a believer that there's a single, best way of doing things and this is just what I prefer to use.

## Baking Pans

I prefer aluminum baking pans, although I don't use aluminum exclusively. I'm a big fan of [Fat Daddio's pans](https://fatdaddios.com). You can't buy directly from the manufacturer but you can find them for sale online and at some retailers selling baking products.

## Food Scale

I use a food scale which has the ability to measure in grams, fluid ounces, ounces, and milliliters. It also has a tare setting making it easy to deduct the weight of the container you're measuring into.

This is probably the biggest product recommendation I have. This allows you to measure ingredients with a high degree of accuracy and reduce error vectors.
