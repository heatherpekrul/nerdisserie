This recipe is for making a chocolate ganache. Note that the ratio of cream to chocolate for this type of ganache is different than that of white chocolate, which has a different chemical makeup.

When working with chocolate, the ratio for making ganache is 1:1 - for every ounce of chocolate you should add one ounce of cream.

When working with white chocolate, the ratio for making ganache is 3:1 - for every 3 ounces of white chocolate you should add one ounce of cream. In some very hot and humid areas, a ratio of 4:1 might work better to ensure the white chocolate ganache isn't too thin.
