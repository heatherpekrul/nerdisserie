  yield: 18 servings
  ingredients: [
      4 large eggs,
      106 g (1 1/4 c) unsweetened cocoa powder,
      1 tbsp vanilla
      1 tsp salt,
      1/2 tsp baking soda,
      16 tbsp unsalted butter,
      447 g (2 1/4 c) sugar,
      177 g (1 1/2 c) all purpose flour,
      1 bag (10 oz) M&Ms minis
    ]
  directions: |-
    1. Preheat the oven to 350&deg; F (177&deg; C). Prepare a 9x13 inch pan with baking grease.
    2. Combine eggs, cocoa powder, vanilla, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Beat at a medium speed with a hand mixer until smooth. The batter will be very thick.
    3. Melt butter in a large measuring cup or a bowl, then mix in the sugar with the butter until incorporated. Heating the mixture a second time in the microwave and then stirring will help the sugar dissolve into the butter.
    4. Add the butter mixture into the other ingredients and mix until smooth.
    5. Add the flour in three parts, mixing between additions. Mix until blended but try to minimize the amount of mixing for a fudgier brownie.
    6. Smooth the batter out into the prepared pan. Bake for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the brownies comes out clean. Cool before cutting and serving.

These are really quick and easy to make. I personally prefer a fudgy brownie to a cakey one, so these are my go-to quick dessert.
