  yield: 24 cookies
  ingredients: [
      330 g (2 3/4 cups) all-purpose flour,
      425 g (2 1/2 cups) chopped chocolate,
      18 tbsp (2 1/4 sticks) softened unsalted butter,
      213 g (1 cup) brown sugar,
      198 g (1 cup) granulated white sugar,
      1 cup finely minced fresh mint,
      2 eggs,
      1 tsp salt,
      1 tsp baking soda,
      1/2 tsp baking powder,
      1 tbsp vanilla extract,
      1/8 tsp nutmeg
    ]
  directions: |-
    1. Brown the butter: In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir the simmering butter until it no longer is bubbling. There may be brown bits on the bottom of the pan, but they will increase the flavor so be sure to include them. Allow to cool until butter is semi-solid.
    2. Preheat oven to 350&deg; F (177&deg; C).
    3. Combine chocolate and flour in a small bowl, stirring to distribute the chocolate.
    4. In a separate bowl, combine the remaining dry ingredients except for the mint. A stand mixer with a paddle attachment is recommended as this dough becomes rather stiff. Beat until the dough is light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.
    5. Add the mint to the butter mixture and beat until incorporated.
    6. Add eggs one at a time and again beating until incorporated.
    7. On low speed, add the flour mixture to the butter mixture slowly, about a half cup at a time, stirring between additions. Continue until the flour is incorporated. The dough will become very stiff.
    8. Bake for 12-15 minutes until the cookies are set and golden around the edges. Allow to cool before transferring to a cooling rack.

These cookies are a twist on a traditional chocolate chip cookie. Browned butter amps up the cookie flavor while the mint and chocolate are an unexpected treat.

Funnily enough, I normally despite mint. I don't even like to use mint toothpaste when I can avoid it. But there's something about the taste of fresh mint in these cookies that I really love.

Be warned that the sight of unidentified green bits in your cookies might spring alarm, but there's nothing illicit in these cookies.

Note that you can include any type of chocolate that you prefer - when I made these for this recipe, I included a mix of white, milk, semi-sweet, and "sea salt caramel" baking bars and chips just because that's what I happened to have in my pantry (and not enough of any one thing to use alone).

I used fresh peppermint for this recipe, but there are a wide variety of mints available - I think anything would work. Use what you prefer!
