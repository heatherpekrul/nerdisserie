  yield: 48 cookies
  ingredients: [
      8 tablespoons (113g) butter, room temperature,
      3/4 cup (149 g) granulated sugar,
      1 teaspoon vanilla extract,
      zest of 1 orange,
      1/2 teaspoon salt,
      1/4 teaspoon baking powder,
      1 large egg,
      1 1/2 cups (180g) all-purpose flour,
      1 cup (170g) dried cranberries,
      1 cup white chocolate chips,
      additional sugar for rolling (approximately 1/2 cup)
    ]
  directions: |-
    1. Preheat the oven to 425&deg; F (218&deg; C). Prepare two baking sheets with baking grease or by lining with parchment or silicone baking mats.
    2. Beat the butter, sugar, vanilla extract, orange zest, salt, and baking powder until the mixture is well-combined.
    3. Add the egg to the butter mixture. Beat until it is also well-combined.
    4. Add the flour, dried cranberries, and white chocolate chips to the butter mixture. Stir until well-combined.
    5. Pour additional sugar into a separate bowl for rolling cookies.
    6. Using a small cookie scoop or similar, scoop out balls of dough and then roll in your hands until round. Drop into the sugar and roll until coated.
    7. Place on to your prepared baking sheet and flatten slightly with the palm of your hand or a glass. Cookies should be 1-2 inches apart.
    8. Bake the cookies for 6-7 minutes. The cookies should be very lightly toasted around the edges (a light brown), and may not appear totally set. This is normal - the cookies will firm up as they cool.
    9. Remove cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet.

I have made these cookies several times and love the bright flavors of citrus and cranberry. They feel so decadent and unique.

I especially like to make these around the holidays. The flavors feel very festive.
