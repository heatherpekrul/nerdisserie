  yield: 2 cups sauce
  ingredients: |-
    * 198 g (1 cup) granulated sugar
    * 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature, divided into 5 pieces
    * 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
    * 1 tsp vanilla
    * 1/2 tsp salt
  directions: |-
    1. Gather and measure all ingredients before making the caramel sauce. Caramel can burn easily, and you want to have everything prepared and in reach before beginning to avoid any mishaps.
    2. Evenly distribute the sugar in the bottom of a medium sauce pan. Cook the sugar over medium heat, stirring frequently with a whisk. The sugar will undergo a chemical reaction causing it to form lumps and eventually liquefy with an amber color, about 7-12 minutes.
    3. Once it has reached an amber color with a nutty aroma, add the butter and whisk until it is melted and incorporated.
    4. Add the heavy whipping cream, whisking quickly to incorporate. Remove the pan from the heat.
    5. Add the vanilla and salt, and whisk until smooth. Pour into a storage container and cool. Note that it will thicken as it cools.
