  yield: 20 servings
  ingredients: [
      260 g (2 cups) all purpose flour,
      414 g (2 cups) sugar,
      70 g (3/4 cup) cocoa powder,
      2 tsp baking soda,
      2 large eggs,
      240 ml (1 cup) buttermilk,
      240 ml (1 cup) vegetable oil,
      1 tsp vanilla extract,
      240 ml (1 cup) boiling water,
    ]
  directions: |-
    1. Preheat oven to 300&deg; F (149&deg; C).
    2. Prepare three 8-inch (20.32 cm) round cake pans with parchment paper along the bottom of the pans. Grease the sides of the pans.
    3. Add all dry ingredients to a large bowl, and stir to combine.
    4. Add eggs, buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix until combined. The batter should be rather thick, but smooth.
    5. Bring water to a boil, and slowly add to the mixed batter. Mix well.
    6. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans. Bake for about 30-33 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out with a few crumbs.
    7. Remove cakes from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes. Remove to cooling racks to cool completely.
    8. The cakes will be very moist, and can be hard to handle as a result. I recommend using parchment paper when handling to avoid the cakes sticking to any surfaces. Wrapping with plastic wrap then freezing these cakes prior to decorating can make them easier to frost.
