This is one of those awkward introductory posts in which I try to justify something so self-serving as a blog documenting what I'm making in the kitchen.

So, hi - hello - I'm Heather. I thoroughly enjoy baking, and to a much lesser extent, cooking. I watch a lot of food television, spend a lot of time perusing recipes online, and work as a software engineer to pay the bills. Hence, the title of this blog in a neat and tidy package.

Baking is both a hobby and, like many people especially in the midwest, a means of showing affection for those around me. I can't say that I've left my grandmother's home without at least being offered food.

Cheers!
